##IDEA
<br>
Main aim of the project was to develop a full fledged and robust database system to track
the details regarding students and their hostel stay along with tracking and storing the
normal in and out movement of students and maintaining a database that can store the
transactions of students related to the hostel payments and other activities common
between hostel and students that can be captured in the database which can capture the
miniworld.we tried to develop the database such that it can handle complex SQL queries
and produce the result with accurate data corresponding to the queries.

Steps to initialize

First of all we need to create database by running *.sql file in mysql workbench or shell 


Then we have to connect with your local database by altering the username and password 



Once this ! we are now ready to use all function ( C R U D operation  ) on the database from python application .  We just need to import dbhelp and all function can be use seamlessly  like any other standard library 


We had also added function which can perform general task , all complex operation as we do on workbench .
